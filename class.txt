Introduction to TypeScript
**************************
	TypeScript is the "Programming" Language

	TypeScript Released by "Microsoft"

	Superset of JavaScript also called as "TypeScript"

	Adv JavaScript and tools also called as "TypeScript"
	
	TypeScript follows the "OOPS".

	TypeScript used to build the React Applications,Angular, NodeJS and VueJS Applications

	extension of TypeScript files is ".ts"

	Browsers "wont" understands the TypeScript.

	Browsers able to understand HTML,CSS,JavaScript.

	So, as a React Developer we must convert TypeScript to Equalent JavaScript

	Conversion of TypeScript to Equalent JavaScript Called as Transpilation

	"tsc" is the tool used to perform "Transpilation"

	tsc stands for "TypeScript Compiler"

	Visual Studio Code IDE is Suggestable IDE to build the both TypeScript and React Applications
	
	VSCode IDE Released By Microsoft and Open Source IDE

	TypeScript installation is "command based Installation"

	TypeScript Installation depending on npm tool

	npm stands for node packaging manager

	npm present in NodeJS

Day-2
*****

Installation of Softwares

1) download and install "NodeJS"

	NodeJS, containes following tools

		=> npm

		=> node

		=> npx

	npm stands for node packaging manager

	npm helps to install the TypeScript

	node tool helps to execute the "JavaScript"
	
	npx stands for "node packaging runner"

	npx helps to create the environment to develop react applications

website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

file    : node-v16.14.0-x64.msi


2) install TypeScript

	TypeScript installation is command based installation


	> npm install -g typescript

	where -g stands for global installation



3) download and install Visual Studio Code

		VScode is the IDE, provided my microsoft and open source IDE

		VSCode IDE Recomended to develop both TypeScript and React Applications


website : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win

file    : VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.64.2.exe


Transpilation
*************
	conversion of typescript code to equalent javascript code called as transpilation

	tsc is the tool, used to perform the transpilation

Ex.

		> tsc demo.ts

			o/p

		demo.js

		> node demo.js


Variables
*********
		Variables are used to store the "data"
		Ex.
				string

				number

				boolean

				arrays

				Objects

				---
				---
				---
		we will "declare" the Variables with var/let/const keyword

		let & const keywords introduced in "ES6"

		Variables declaration should contain 

			a-z

			A-Z

			0-9

			$

			and 

			_

		Variables declaration should not start with "digits"

Syntax
******

var/let/const variablename:datatype = value;

Ex.

var msg:string = "welcome to reactjs"
console.log( msg );
